Uses Andrew Graham's js.cfc (blog.atozofweb.com) to load scripts. It can load remote URLs or inline via cfsavecontent. The example here runs compileString() from asual's engine.js; compileFile() is also an option. Js.cfc has an onMissingMethod handler that puts a CF face to the underlying javascript scope. One last note, this was the most painless way to run LESS CSS from ColdFusion.
