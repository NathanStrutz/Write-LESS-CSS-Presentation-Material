<h1>Development Recommendation</h1>
<p>In your development environment, especially local development, use the LESS.js compiler. You already have the fastest browsers and the most powerful workstations. You need to see immediate error feedback and you need your changes reflected without compiling or building your project. The LESS.js compiler is the way to do that.</p>
