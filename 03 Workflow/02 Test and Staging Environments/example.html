<h1>Test and Staging Recommendation</h1>
<p>In your test and staging environments, you will want to compile your LESS files before they go into testing. This will give you the finished product packaged like you want it, but it's not going to minify it because you need to be able to debug your CSS, or at least look for problems.</p>
